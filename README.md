## Requirements

### Game Version
**Mages & Vikings** requires **Skyrim Anniversary Edition with all Creation Club content**, version 1.6.1170.

### System Requirements
This modlist is optimized for performance without sacrificing visual quality. While most textures are 2K (and 1K where appropriate), **Mages & Vikings** prioritizes stunning visuals with dense forests, realistic grass, and full ENB effects. 

To fully enjoy this experience, the following hardware is recommended:
- **GPU**: RTX 4070 or higher
- **RAM**: 32GB
- **CPU**: A modern, high-performance processor
- **Storage**: The required disk space is shown in the Wabbajack UI

>[!TIP]
>You can choose separate locations for the modlist installation and the downloads folder—helpful if one of your drives is low on space. Note that after installation, downloads can be safely deleted, but will need to be re-downloaded if you update the list later.

## Installation

### Pre-installation  

Before starting, ensure the following:  

- You are running an **up-to-date version of Windows**. Download and install the following dependencies:  
    - [Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)  
    - [.NET 6.0 Runtime Desktop x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.30-windows-x64-installer)  
    - [.NET Desktop Runtime 8.X.X x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

>[!WARNING]
>If you already have Visual C++ installed, ensure you run the installer again and select the `Repair` option to update to the latest redistributables. **Do NOT skip this step, or Mod Organizer 2 and the game may fail to launch.**

- You own a **legal, non-pirated version** of the game updated to **1.6.1170** (the latest version).  

Follow these steps:
1. **Disable Automatic Updates for Skyrim:**
   - In Steam, right-click on *Skyrim SE*, select **Properties**, navigate to **Updates**, and set it to *Only update this game when I launch it*.
2. **Set the Game Language to English and disable the Steam Overlay:**
   - In Steam, right-click on *Skyrim SE*, select **Properties**. Under **General**, set the **Language** to *English*.
   - Still in the **General** tab under Properties, toggle "Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game" to *off*.
3. **Run Skyrim Once:**
   - Launch the game to allow it to perform its initial graphics check. The settings will be replaced during installation, so there's no need to configure them now.
5. **Download Add-ons:**
   - Start the game, reach the main menu, and allow it to download the Creation Club content included with the Anniversary Edition.

### Installation

1. **Install Wabbajack:**
   - Download and install [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/).

2. **Get the Mages & Vikings Modlist:**
   - Method 1 (from Wabbajack): Open Wabbajack, click "Browse Lists," search for "Mages & Vikings," then click the download button.
   - Method 2 (from Nexus): Obtain the `Mages & Vikings.wabbajack` file from the [Nexus Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136238). Make sure to unzip the downloaded file.

3. **Follow the Wabbajack Installation Procedure:**
   - Refer to the section [_The Core Procedure for Using a Downloaded .wabbajack File_](https://wiki.wabbajack.org/user_documentation/Installing%20a%20Modlist.html) in the Wabbajack Documentation.

---

### If Installation Fails  

1. **Unable to download 'Curios' files**
   - If you're experiencing issues downloading the Curios files, please refer to the relevant section in the [Wabbajack Troubleshooting FAQ](https://wiki.wabbajack.org/user_documentation/Troubleshooting%20FAQ.html#unable-to-download-curios-files).

2. **Missing Manual Downloads**  
   - A common reason for failure is **Missing Manual Downloads**, where Wabbajack could not download certain files automatically.  
     - You can run Wabbajack again to retry the download.  
     - Alternatively, manually download the missing files. Place these files in the same directory as your other downloads (by default, this is `[Your Installation]\downloads`) before restarting Wabbajack.

3. **_Operation did not complete successfully because the file contains a virus or potentially unwanted software._**

   2. Type "Windows Defender" in the search bar and select **Windows Security**.  
   3. Click on **Virus & threat protection** in the left pane.  
   4. Select **Manage settings** under "Virus & threat protection settings".  
   5. Scroll down to **Exclusions** and click **Add or remove exclusions**.  
   6. When prompted by Windows, click **Yes** to allow administrator access.  
   7. Click **Add an exclusion** and choose **Folder**.  
   8. Navigate to the installation folder for the modlist and click **Select Folder**.  
   9. Resume the installation.  

4. **Double-check Requirements**
   - Ensure you’ve met all the listed requirements and completed the pre-installation process correctly.

5. **Seek Help for Other Issues**  
   - If none of the above resolves your problem, refer to the official [Wabbajack Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack) for guidance and troubleshooting.
