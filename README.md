## Requirements

### Game Version
**Mages & Vikings** requires **Skyrim Anniversary Edition with all Creation Club content**, version 1.6.1170.

### System Requirements
This modlist is optimized for performance without sacrificing visual quality. While most textures are 2K (and 1K where appropriate), **Mages & Vikings** prioritizes stunning visuals with dense forests, realistic grass, and full ENB effects. 

To fully enjoy this experience, the following hardware is recommended:
- **GPU**: RTX 4070 or higher
- **RAM**: 32GB
- **CPU**: A modern, high-performance processor
- **Storage**: The required disk space is shown in the Wabbajack UI

>[!TIP]
>You can choose separate locations for the modlist installation and the downloads folder – helpful if one of your drives is low on space. Note that after installation, downloads can be safely deleted, but will need to be re-downloaded if you update the list later.

## Installation

### Pre-installation  

Before starting, ensure the following:  
- You own a **legal, non-pirated version** of the game updated to **1.6.1170** (the latest version).
- You are running an **up-to-date version of Windows**. Download and install the following dependencies:  
    - [Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)  
    - [.NET 6.0 Runtime Desktop x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.30-windows-x64-installer)  
    - [.NET Desktop Runtime 8.X.X x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

>[!WARNING]
>If you already have Visual C++ installed, ensure you run the installer again and select the `Repair` option to update to the latest redistributables. **Do NOT skip this step, or Mod Organizer 2 and the game may fail to launch.**

Then follow these steps:
1. **Disable the Steam Overlay, set the Game Language to English and disable Automatic Updates for Skyrim:**
   - In Steam, right-click on *Skyrim SE*, select **Properties** and under **General**, toggle "Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game" to *off*.
   - Still under **General**, set the **Language** to *English*.
   - Then navigate to **Updates**, and set it to *Only update this game when I launch it*.
2. **Run Skyrim Once:**
   - Launch the game to allow it to perform its initial graphics check. The settings will be replaced during installation, so there's no need to configure them now.
3. **Download Add-ons:**
   - Start the game, reach the main menu, and allow it to download the Creation Club content included with the Anniversary Edition.

### Starting the installation

1. **Install Wabbajack:**

2. **Get the Mages & Vikings Modlist:**
   - Method 1 (from Wabbajack): Open Wabbajack, click "Browse Lists" then search for "Mages & Vikings".
   - Method 2 (from Nexus): Obtain the `Mages & Vikings.wabbajack` file from the [Nexus Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136238). Make sure to unzip the downloaded file.

### If Installation Fails  

- **Unable to download 'Curios' files**  
If you're experiencing issues downloading the Curios files, please refer to the relevant section in the [Wabbajack Troubleshooting FAQ](https://wiki.wabbajack.org/user_documentation/Troubleshooting%20FAQ.html#unable-to-download-curios-files).

- **Missing Manual Downloads**  
A common reason for failure is **Missing Manual Downloads**, where Wabbajack could not download certain files automatically.
  - You can run Wabbajack again to retry the download.
  - Alternatively, manually download the missing files. Place these files in the same directory as your other downloads (by default, this is `[Your Installation]\downloads`) before restarting Wabbajack. Files that tend to fail to download include:
