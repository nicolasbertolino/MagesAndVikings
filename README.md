## Requirements

### Game Version
**Mages & Vikings** requires the **Skyrim Anniversary Edition** with all Creation Club content. The modlist is built for the **1.5.97 version** of the game, utilizing the _Best of Both Worlds_ patcher to integrate the additional content from version **1.6.1170**.

### System Requirements
This modlist is optimized for performance without sacrificing visual quality. While most textures are 2K (and 1K where appropriate), **Mages & Vikings** prioritizes stunning visuals with dense forests, realistic grass, and full ENB effects. 

To fully enjoy this experience, the following hardware is recommended:
- **GPU**: RTX 4070 or higher
- **RAM**: 32GB
- **CPU**: A modern, high-performance processor
- **500 GB** of disk space

>[!TIP]
>Also recommended is [Lossless Scaling](https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/), which employs machine learning for scaling and frame generation, offering a smoother experience.


## Installation

### Pre-installation  

Before starting, ensure the following:  

- You are running an **up-to-date version of Windows**. Download and install the following dependencies:  
    - [Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)  
    - [.NET 6.0 Runtime Desktop x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.30-windows-x64-installer)  
    - [.NET Runtime 8.X.X Desktop x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

>[!WARNING]
>If you already have Visual C++ installed, ensure you run the installer again and select the `Repair` option to update to the latest redistributables. **Do NOT skip this step, or Mod Organizer 2 and the game may fail to launch.**

- You own a **legal, non-pirated version** of the game updated to **1.6.1170** (the latest version).  

Follow these steps:
1. **Disable Automatic Updates for Skyrim:**
   - In Steam, right-click on *Skyrim SE*, select **Properties**, navigate to **Updates**, and set it to *Only update this game when I launch it*.
2. **Set the Game Language to English:**
   - In Steam, right-click on *Skyrim SE*, select **Properties**. Under **General**, set the **Language** to *English*.
3. **Run Skyrim Once:**
   - Launch the game to allow it to perform its initial graphics check. The settings will be replaced during installation, so there's no need to configure them now.
4. **Download Add-ons:**
   - Start the game, reach the main menu, and allow it to download the Creation Club content included with the Anniversary Edition.

### Installation

1. **Install Wabbajack:**
   - Download and install [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/).

2. **Download the Mages & Vikings Wabbajack File:**
   - Obtain the `Mages & Vikings.wabbajack` file from the [Nexus Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136238). Make sure to unzip the downloaded file.

3. **Follow the Wabbajack Installation Procedure:**

### If Installation Fails  

If your installation fails, follow these steps:  

1. **Double-check Requirements**  
   - Ensure you’ve met all the listed requirements and completed the pre-installation process correctly.  

2. **Address Missing Manual Downloads**  
   - A common reason for failure is **Missing Manual Downloads**, where Wabbajack could not download certain files automatically.  
     - You can run Wabbajack again to retry the download.  
     - Alternatively, manually download the missing files. Place these files in the same directory as your other downloads (by default, this is `[Your Installation]\downloads`) before restarting Wabbajack.
     - If you are unable to download 'Curios' files, refer to the corresponding [Wabbajack documentation](https://wiki.wabbajack.org/user_documentation/Troubleshooting%20FAQ.html#unable-to-download-curios-files).
